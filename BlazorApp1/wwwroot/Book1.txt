11	sports	"Under Coach Brian Flores and general manager Chris Grier, the only thing more shocking than the Miami Dolphins being relevant in November is the team’s organizational competence.The Miami Dolphins were arguably the N.F.L.’s least relevant team from the turn of the 21st century until two Sundays ago.They were never truly great during that span, but were rarely terrible enough to be comically entertaining, either. They produced few stars or personalities and fewer memorable moments. The Dolphins of the last two decades appeared to exist solely to provide a place holder in the A.F.C. East standings to visibly illustrate the chasm between the New England Patriots and the Jets.All of that was beginning to change when the rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa made his highly-anticipated debut as a starter on Nov. 1 against the Los Angeles Rams. The Dolphins have won two straight games with Tagovailoa leading their offense and are now enjoying their first four-game winning streak since 2016.Tagovailoa has been solid-but-unspectacular in his first two starts. His two-touchdown performance in Sunday’s 34-31 victory over the Arizona Cardinals was encouraging, but he did little in his first start except hold the steering wheel and sit in his defense’s lap while it forced four turnovers. Tagovailoa makes the Dolphins interesting, but it’s second-year head coach Brian Flores who is making the team competitive."
12	sports	"Bieber, a right-hander for Cleveland, led all major league pitchers in several statistical categories, and Bauer, a right-hander for Cincinnati, wasn’t far behind.Shane Bieber still keeps a screenshot in his cellphone of a text message exchange he had earlier this year with Trevor Bauer, a former teammate in Cleveland whose locker was next to his. Although the Indians traded Bauer to the Cincinnati Reds midway through the 2019 season, the two starting pitchers still stay in frequent touch. And before the 2020 season began, they had similar betting odds to win the Cy Young Awards in their leagues.“That’s not something I pay too much attention to,” said Bieber, who is more reserved than the brash Bauer. “But he kind of does and he texted it to me, and it goes back to this friendly competition that we have with each other. All I replied back was like, ‘Hey, why not go to 2 for 2?’ And he said, ‘Sounds like a deal.’”Their wish came true on Wednesday: Bieber was named the unanimous winner of the American League Cy Young Award for the truncated 2020 Major League Baseball season, while Bauer claimed the National League Cy Young Award. They are the first pitchers to earn the awards in the same year after being teammates in the prior season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.“We talked a little bit throughout the year about how cool it would be to have ex teammates win the award together, and here we are,” Bauer said on a conference call with reporters. Added Bieber: “It means the world.”"
13	sports	"At Augusta National, Not Talking About Race Is TraditionA plan to honor Lee Elder, the first Black golfer to compete in the Masters, highlights the glacial pace of change at the club that hosts golf’s marquee event.The coronavirus pandemic has silenced the Masters Tournament’s resonant roars. It has erased the par-3 contest, drained the color from the wintering azaleas and brought brisk north winds into play for the first time. This week’s tournament, rescheduled from the first major of the year to the last and stripped down to better safeguard the participants from the virus, is happening in one kind of bubble.But Augusta National has always existed in a bubble, a byproduct of a famously private club consolidating its influence and then enforcing it over the decades while maintaining practices that, throughout most of its storied history, were exclusionary and racist.The Masters, first played in 1934, didn’t extend an invitation to a Black competitor until 1975. The club didn’t admit its first Black member util 1990 and didn’t offer membership to women until 2012.As host to what is considered the most prestigious event on the golf calendar, on the most exquisite course that money can maintain, Augusta National serves up a history that is Southern comfort food for the pilgrim’s soul but leaves out the unappetizing bits."
14	sports	"Cleveland Indians ace Shane Bieber was the unanimous winner of the AL Cy Young Award on Wednesday, capping an impressive rise by the right-hander to his status as one of the game's best pitchers. Using a versatile repertoire that includes a looping curveball and a wipeout slider, Bieber went 8-1 with a 1.63 ERA and 122 strikeouts in 77? innings during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, leading the majors in ERA and strikeouts, and tying Yu Darvish for the most wins. Bieber became the second player in franchise history to win the pitching AL Triple Crown, joining Hall of Famer Bob Feller in 1940. He was the first pitcher to lead the majors in all three categories since Johan Santana for Minnesota in 2006. Twins right-hander Kenta Maeda finished second in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, followed by Toronto Blue Jays left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu. Bieber was the first unanimous American League winner since"
15	sports	"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- A week after the NFL and players' union opened an investigation into the San Francisco 49ers' compliance with the league's COVID-19 protocols, the team has been cleared of any potential violations. A league source confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday that after a review of the team's adherence to the NFL guidelines, the Niners were found to have met the necessary requirements and that no further action would be taken against them. The Associated Press first reported the news about the 49ers being cleared of any potential violations.  The investigation into the Niners began last week after receiver Kendrick Bourne tested positive and the team had to shut down its facilities before Thursday night's game against the Green Bay Packers. The league examined whether Bourne had been wearing his protective face covering properly and frequently enough. Bourne, fellow receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, and left tackle"
16	sports	"Penn State running back Journey Brown is medically retiring from football after being diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Head coach James Franklin announced Wednesday night that the redshirt junior would no longer be able to play. Brown had been held out of the season, as Penn State announced in October that a medical condition was discovered in the offseason. According to WebMD, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ""is associated with thickening of the heart muscle ... which leads to stiffening of the walls of the heart and abnormal aortic and mitral heart valve function, both of which may impede normal blood flow out of the heart."" ""It was discovered through a routine COVID-19 test, although it is not COVID-related,"" Franklin said. ""We learned about this in early September, and we've been working through this and dealing with this as a team. Journey is one of the most popular and respected players on our team. ""The entire organization has rallied behind Journey and his"
17	sports	"The Cincinnati Reds' Trevor Bauer has won the National League Cy Young Award, giving Cincinnati its first winner of the award. Bauer topped fellow finalists Yu Darvish of the Chicago Cubs and Jacob deGrom of the New York Mets in the voting announced by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Wednesday. DeGrom was looking to become the third pitcher in MLB history to win the award in three consecutive seasons. The Reds had never had a Cy Young winner, making them one of four active MLB teams without a Cy Young winner and the only team founded prior to 1961 without one. Bauer ended that drought. He went 5-4 with a league-leading 1.73 ERA, a 100-17 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 73 innings and an opponents' batting average of .159. Late in the season, with the Reds fighting for a playoff spot, he beat the Brewers on short rest, allowing one run with 12 K's in eight innings. This is the first Cy Young for Bauer, who tied for"
18	sports	"Catcher J.T. Realmuto, outfielder George Springer and second baseman DJ LeMahieu rejected their qualifying offers on Wednesday, the deadline for players who received the $18.9 million offer to decide on it. Right-hander Trevor Bauer had previously rejected his offer. If the four players sign with another team in free agency, their former teams will receive draft-pick compensation at the end of the first round in the 2021 draft or at the end of competitive balance round B. The placement depends on whether the new contract is worth $50 million or more and the revenue-sharing and luxury tax status of the team losing the player. A team signing the player would give up either its third-highest draft pick, its second-highest pick and $500,000 of international signing bonus allotment, or its second- and fifth-highest selections and $1 million of international signing bonus allotment, depending on revenue-sharing and luxury tax status of the signing"
19	sports	"Former San Antonio Spurs superstar Tim Duncan has decided to step away from his position as a full-time assistant coach for the team, a source said, confirming a New York Times report. Duncan, part of the Basketball Hall of Fame's 2020 class, spent last season on coach Gregg Popovich's staff. However, he did not join the Spurs in the Orlando, Florida, bubble for the NBA's restart, remaining in San Antonio to help LaMarcus Aldridge rehabilitate from shoulder surgery. Popovich frequently credited Duncan for being a key factor in creating and maintaining the culture that helped the Spurs win five NBA championships. Duncan spent his entire 19-year career in San Antonio, earning 15 All-Star appearances, two MVPs, three Finals MVPs and a Rookie of the Year award. The first three years after Duncan's retirement, he was not an official member of the Spurs' coaching staff but was a frequent visitor to the team's practice facility. After Duncan agreed to become an assistant"
20	sports	"The Kansas City Chiefs asked the NFL to begin an inquiry with the players' association after a union representative held a meeting with the full team late in October without wearing a mask, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. The National Football League Players Association representative was in proximity while meeting with the players, a source told Schefter. The union representative is not subject to the same COVID-19 testing as players and regularly travels among the teams, the source said. The Chiefs have had a handful of players on the NFL's reserve/COVID-19 list this season, including wide receiver Mecole Hardman, who was placed on the list on Wednesday. Hardman is fourth on the Chiefs in receptions, with 25, and third in receiving yards (395) and touchdowns (three). The Chiefs have their bye this week and next play against the Raiders in Las Vegas in Week 11. Last week, the Chiefs put defensive lineman Chris Jones on the list, though he was activated the"
